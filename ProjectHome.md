Initially aiming for .NET 2.0 (C#) based HTML5 parser/tokenizer and serializer implementations.
The parser/tokenizer is a `System.Xml.XmlReader` subclass, while serializers are available as both `System.Xml.XmlWriter` and `System.Web.UI.HtmlWriter` subclasses.

The code is not usable yet.

Later improvements might include CSS and/or feed (Atom and RSS) support.
